                I currently work at BYUI as a Tutor for the C language class and a Early Morning Custodian for the college.
                Next semester I will be working those two jobs, along with a TA job. I will be the TA for a CSE 111(programming with functions) class
                this class is taught in Python. I find that so far teaching has been my favorite job experience. While being a custodian has taught me 
                how to effectively work with a team, I find that teaching is far more rewarding. I like to sit down with people and help them
                with any problems they have, especially with something such as programming, which I am very passionate about.

                Before working at BYUI, I worked as a supervisor at a local Pizza company in Rexburg called Doorzza. I really loved
                my time working here, and quit in January of 2023. I started my job there in August of 2021. My responsibilities were to 
                ensure that everyone was working, and make sure they did they're job effectively and efficiently.
                I had to make sure everything ran quickly and smoothly as I was the only person in a leadership position most times.
                I found that teamwork and delegation was always very important. If we all didn't work together to get our tasks
                done properly nothing would have gotten done. Especially in a kitchen atmosphere teamwork is essential.
