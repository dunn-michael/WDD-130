                    Hi! My name is Michael Dunn. I am currently a student at BYUI 
                    studying Software Engineering with a Emphasis in Web Development.
                    Here is my online Portfolio. On here you can see things i've worked on, a little bit about me
                    and jobs I've worked in the past. Hopefuly by looking at this webpage you can see some of the skills
                    I have acquired while studying at BYUI. You can also find pictures of me doing things
                    I enjoy, such as hanging out with my bird, or going on hikes with my friends.
                    The picture below is me with my friends after white water rafting. Having a community has always been
                    important to me, so I wanted to showcase some of my best friends.

                    Something else is I have always loved Animals. I find it's easy to stay stress free
                    and happy when you have something cute to come home to. It always makes life a little bit
                    better when you have a furry, or in my case feathery friend to see.
                    This is a picture of my with my bird Stella, she is a Green Cheek Conure and for sure one of
                    my best friends.
