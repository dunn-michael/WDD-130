                If you look to the right you will see my Resume. In High school I did a program
                called Running Start, which allowed me to be a full time college student for my junior and senior years
                so that I could get some credits under my belt before real college.
                After that I immediately had gone to Portland State University where I studied
                Biology for a semester, before I decided it wasn't for me. I then came to Brigham Young University - Idaho 
                Where I now study Software Engineering. I have taken programming classes in the past, and
                have a basic to intermediate knowledge of all of them.
                I have also used various IDE in the past so I can get a better understanding of how
                different things work.

                Some more random information about me is that I love going outside. I always have, I am from the Portland
                Oregon area so there's plenty of beautiful sites to see and hikes to go on. But I don't limit myself to
                only going outside during the summertime. In winter you can find me on Mount Hood barreling down the mountain
                on my snowboard. It's important to seperate work from play, it helps to keep a stress free life. I do this by
                going outside with my friends and loved ones.
