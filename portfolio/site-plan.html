      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People are going to come to my site to learn more about me and my life, they are going to come to my site to see if I am going to be a good for their job.
         My website will hopefully help them come to a conclusion of whether or not they will hire me into their companies.

         There are no real activities that visitors will want to complete on my site. Im planning on having links to my previous projects, a long with pictures, and explanations of what they were,
          and how I did it. Explanations about how I thought through the processes, the struggles I had, and how I finally came to the conclusion on how to fix the problems.

        The homepage will include pertinent pictures of me, and a quick life story so that employers can better understand who I am.
        This will help for them to better consider me for a job position.

        
      </p>
      <p>
        My visitors will come to my site instead of another to get this information because, it can be easy to say I can make and design a website on a resume. It doesn’t take any skill whatsoever to say I can do anything, and it doesn’t showcase who I am as a person, or the kind of abilities I have gotten from school, and built upon in my own time. However doing a portfolio website like this is a physical representation of some of my skills. If a future employer wants to come and see what kind of work I do, and how proficient I am in certain topics they will get a literal representation of what I do and how I do it. I am hoping that by seeing my skills, and seeing my resume and the other important information I will be putting on this website that they will be more likely to consider me as an option for they company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some questions my visitors will expect my site to answer for them are, what kind of a person is Michael? Is he a good fit for the job? What are his hobbies? Where’s he from? Is he a good person? What kind of a worker is he? And what kind of experience, or technical skills does he have that relate to this field?

      <h3>Resume</h3>
      <p>
        On this page the viewer will see important information about me, they will see my resume, and possibly some projects i've worked on in
        in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        I won’t only be putting serious job related stuff about me on this webpage. I plan on putting a bit of information so that they can get to know me on a more personal level. I think it’s important that if they want to hire me they know who I am and what kind hobbies I like to participate in, in my spare time. So I plan on discussing how I spend my time, what I plan on doing with my future, and the kind of person I am outside of work. I plan on putting pictures of some of my hobbies with a short description of what they are, and what I find interesting about it.

      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>
        On this page I am going to show information about my previous jobs and classes, and list reasons why I would be good for certain positions.
        I am going to list the programming languages I know, the classes I've taken and talk about my work ethic and who I am as a person.
